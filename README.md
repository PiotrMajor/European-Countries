# European-Countries
This kernel analyzes the data of life satisfaction in 32 European countries. Firstly, I show what countries have the highest life satisfaction. Next, I use a correlation matrix to dive deeper into what factors contribute to a happy lifestyle and which countries are the best to live in.

The data comes from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/roshansharma/europe-datasets
